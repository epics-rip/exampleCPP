<h2>Background</h2>
<h3>EPICS before EPICS 7</h3>
<p>EPICS, which has existed and evolved since about 1990,
implements a client/server model where a TCP/IP network is used for
communication between clients and servers.
The network protocol is called channel access (also refered to as just <b>ca</b>).
</p>
<p>
One important type of server is an IOC ( Input/Output Controller)
which controls and/or collects data from hardware.
This type of server consists of a set of DBRecords.
Each DBRecord has a unique network wide name, which clients refer to as the
channelName.
</p>
<p>
An IOC can have an arbitary number of record types.
Each record type defines a set of fields as a flat record structure.
There is also a set of fields that is common to all record types.
Examples are alarm and timeStamp.
</p>
<h3>EPICS 7 adds PVA</h3>
<p>
EPICS 7 adds PVA, which is support for structured data.
PVA consists of the following components:
</p>
<dl>
   <dt>pvData</dt>
      <dd>An API and implementation for structured data.</dd>
   <dt>normativeTypes</dt>
       <dd>
         An API and implementation for a set of well defined pvData structures.
         This allows the creation of tools and services that support
         one or more normative types.
       </dd>   
   <dt>pvAccess</dt>
      <dd>
         An API and implementation for network communication between
         client and server. The network protocal, called <b>pva</b>,
         provides full support for transfering structured data as defined by
         <b>pvData</b>. Like <b>ca</b>  a TCP/IP network is used for
          communication between clients and servers.
      </dd>
    <dt>pva2pva</dt>
      <dd>
         This provides:
         <dl>
          <dt>qsrv</dt>
          <dd>
             A <b>pva</b> channel provider named <b>qsrv</b>
             that provides access to DBRecords.
          </dd>
          <dt>p2p</dt>
          <dd>
             A PVA network gateway, named <b>p2p</b>.
          </dd>
          </dl>
      </dd>

   <dt>pvaClient</dt>
      <dd>
       An API for writing PVA client code.
       The pvAccess API is asynchronous callback based.
       pvaClient provides a combination of synchronous and asynchronous
       access.
       It is easier to use than pvAccess itself.
      </dd>
   <dt>pvDatabase</dt>
      <dd>
        This provides two components:
          <dl>
             <dt>PVDatabase</dt>
                <dd>
                  This is a database of memory resident <b>PVRecord</b>s.
                  Each PVRecord has:
                  <dl>
                     <dt>data</dt>
                     <dd>
                       A pvData structure.
                     </dd>
                     <dt>code</dt>
                     <dd>
                        A PVRecord has associated code,
                        with one method named <b>process</b>.
                        The process method can be triggered by <b>pva</b> clients.
                     </dd>
                  </dl>
                </dd>
             <dt>local</dt>
               <dd>
                 This is a channel provider for accessing PVRecords.
               </dd>
         </dl>
      </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
This project provides a set of examples of client and server code for PVA.
Each example can be built separately by building in the example subdirectory.
The complete set of examples, except for ChannelArchiverService can also be built by building in exampleCPP itself.
</p>
<p>The main purpose of these examples is to understand and create new code for EPICS V4.
This document assumes that the reader also looks at the source code for the examples.
The reader should also be familiar with

<h2>Building</h2>


<h3>Building via exampleCPP</h3>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<p>
make requires:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
 A proper <b>RELEASE.local</b> is present one directory level above <b>exampleCPP</b>.
 </li>
 <li>
 Either <b>ExampleRELEASE.local</b> or <b>MasterRELEASE.local</b> is used.
 </li>
</ul>
<p><b>ExampleRELEASE.local</b> is used to build via an official <b>EPICS 7</b>
release.
<br />
<b>MasterRELEASE.local</b> is used to build via modules that have been cloned from github.
</p>
<p>In either case the file chosen is copied to configure, renamed, and edited.
For example:
</p>
<pre>
cp ExampleRELEASE.local configure/RELEASE.local
gedit configure/RELEASE.local   // change EPICS7_DIR and possibly EPICS_BASE
</pre>
<p>
The definition of <b>EPICS7_DIR</b> must be changed to the location where You 
installed and built a version of <b>EPICS7</b>.
</p>
<h4>Build</h4>
<p>
To build just type:
</p>
<pre>
make
</pre>

<h3>Building an individual example</h3>
<p>
In the example directory just type:
</p>
<pre>
make
</pre>
<p>
Each example has a <b>README.md</b> file.
</p>
<h3>Each example is a template</h3>
<p>
Each example can be used as a template for building other applications:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Choose an example that is similar to the desired application.</li>
  <li>Copy the complete example to where the desired application should reside.</li>
  <li>Also copy <b>ExampleRELEASE.local</b> and <b>MasterRELEASE.local</b>.</li>
  <li>Edit the new application</li>
</ul>

<h2>Brief summary of examples and links to documentation</h2>
<h3>database and exampleClient</h3>
<p>These two examples are closely related:
<b>database</b> implements a server that is accessed by the examples in
<b>exampleClient</b>
</p>
<h4>database</h4>
<p>
Provides an EPICS IOC that has both EPICS V3 DBRecords, V4 PVRecords, and qsrv for accessing the DBRecords.
</p>
<p>
It can also create a standalone main that has a set of V4 PVRecords.
</p>

<p>Documentation:<a href="./database.html">database</a></p>

<h4>exampleClient</h4>
<p>
Provides a set of examples that use pvaClientCPP.
</p>
<p>Documentation:<a href="./exampleClient.html">exampleClient</a></p>
<p>
In order to run the examples, <b>database</b> must also be built and then the IOC database must be started as follows:
</p>
<pre>
mrk&gt; pwd
/home/epicsv4/master/exampleCPP/database/iocBoot/exampleDatabase
mrk&gt; ../../bin/linux-x86_64/exampleDatabase st.cmd
</pre>
<h3>support</h3>
See:
<a
      href="https://mrkraimer.github.io/website/developerGuide/recordSupport/recordSupport.html">
      developerGuide
</a> 

<h3>json</h3>
<p>
This creates records that use the <b>JSON</b> parser supported provided by 
<b>pvaClientCPP</b>.
</p>
<p>Documentation:<a href="./json.html">json</a></p>

<h3>exampleLink</h3>
<p>
This implements a server that has records exampleGetLink, exampleMonitorLink, and examplePutLink.
Each has a link to another record.
The other record can be in the same server or in another server including a V3 IOC DBRecord.
</p>
<p>
The example records can use provider <b>pva</b> or <b>ca</b> to connect to the other record.
</p>

<p>Documentation:<a href="./exampleLink.html">exampleLink</a></p>

<h3>helloPutGet</h3>
<p>
Implements a PVRecord that is an example of a PVRecord intended to ba accessed via channelPutGet.
It is a simple HelloWorld example.
</p>
<p>Documentation:<a href="./helloPutGet.html">helloPutGet</a></p>
<h3>helloRPC</h3>
<p>
This implements HelloWorld that is accessed via channelRPC.
</p>
<p>Documentation:<a href="./helloRPC.html">helloRPC</a></p>

<h3>pvDatabaseRPC</h3>
<p>
An example of a pvDatabase PVRecord which also supports multiple RPC services.
</p>
<p>It illustrates synchronous and asynchronous RPC services, selecting services
based on the supplied pvRequest to talk to an existing
object which has no knowledge of EPICS and call its methods, so creating 
distributed objects.</p>

<p>It represents a device which has a 2D position setpoint and readback as well
as a state. Each field has a time stamp, as does the record itself.
The device can be controlled through a client using RPC commands
to move through a sequence of points as well as conventionally by putting to
the setpoint. Commands are: configuring the set of points, starting a scan
(blocking or non-blocking), pausing and resuming, rewinding and stopping/aborting.</p>
<p>
A client <b>control</b> for calling the services is supplied.
</p>

<p>Documentation:<a href="./pvDatabaseRPC.html">pvDatabaseRPC</a></p>


<h3>powerSupply</h3>
<p>
This is an example of creating a PVRecord that uses a somewhat complicated top level PVStructure.
It simulates a power supply.
</p>

<p>Documentation:<a href="./powerSupply.html">powerSupply</a></p>



<h3>arrayPerformance</h3>
<p>
This is an example that shows performance for an array of longs.
</p>
<p>Documentation:<a href="./arrayPerformance.html">arrayPerformance</a></p>

<h3>ChannelArchiverService</h3>
<p>
The ChannelArchiver Service is an EPICS V4 client and server which can be used
to query the data archived by an EPICS Channel Archiver. It includes a bash
script, gethist, which can parse a wide range of dates and times and process
the corresponding data. However the service can be queried by any client
issuing a pvAccess RPC request, such as eget. Requests and responses use EPICS V4
normative types. Requests are in the form of an NTURI normative type and the results are returned as an NTTable.
